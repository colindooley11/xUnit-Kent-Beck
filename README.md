# xUnit-Kent-Beck
The xUnit example from Test Driven Design By Example - Kent Beck

The tests are setup and executed in the UnitTests project in the Program.cs file which is a ConsoleApp and not a typical Test project executed by a TestRunner.  

The test framework has been developed in the project named xUnit (it is not actually xUnit of course). 

The TestCaseAssert test, although present, is incomplete and is commented out in "Program.cs" which is where the TestSuite and associated Tests are set up.
